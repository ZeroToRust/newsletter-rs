# Database Selection

This involves choosing the best database to meet the project requirements.

## Why Does an Email Newsletter Need a Database?"

 A database is essential in an email newsletter system by providing advanced data structuring, high-performance querying, and reliable multi-user concurrency management.

- ### Data Volume

  An email newsletter system must store and manage large volumes of subscriber information, including email addresses, preferences, and delivery statuses. As the number of users grows, efficient data storage and fast retrieval become crucial.

- ### Complexity

  Newsletters require maintaining relationships between subscribers, email campaigns, delivery statuses, and user interactions (e.g., opens, clicks, bounces). A structured database ensures these relationships are properly stored and managed.

- ### Transaction Requirements

  A robust database ensures data integrity and consistency. Features like ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) prevent data loss or duplication. For example:

  - If a user subscribes, the system confirms the change before committing it.

  - If an email fails to send, the database ensures it can be retried without duplication

## Comparing Database Types

Comparing different database types will help to determine the best choice.  

|Database type|Exmaples | Adantages | Disadvantages|
|---------|------------|------------|---------------|
Relational Database |Postgress , Mysql , Oracle | Powerful query abilities, Good for stucture data with relationship and Ensures data consistency | Not flexible and slow for large unstructured data
Non Relational Database| MongoDB , Cassandra |Very flexible , Handles large amount of data efficiently  | Not suitable for data with  relationships and Low data consistency
In-Memmory Database | Redis , Memcached | Very fast as it have direct acess to memory | Data loss if memory is wiped and limited storage capacity
Time Series Database| InfluxDB , TimescaleDB |Event tracking and Real-time analytics | Not suitable for data with complex relationships
Graph Database|Neo4j, ArangoDB|  Building recommandation system and analyse relashionship between data | Not efficient for transactional data and Hard to scale

Based on our project needs (structured relationships, reliable transactions, and security), a relational database is the best choice.

## Why PostgreSQL?

Among relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server), PostgreSQL stands out due to the following reasons:

- #### Scalability for Large Datasets

  As the number of subscribers grows, PostgreSQL efficiently handles millions of records with advanced indexing and query optimization.

- #### Security and privacy

  Subscriber information must be secure. PostgreSQL provides:

  - Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.

  - SSL encryption to protect subscriber emails from unauthorized interception.

- #### Advance Quering and reporting

PostgreSQL offers:  

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.  
- Window functions for analyzing subscriber engagement (e.g., tracking open rates, click-through rates).  
- JSON support, which allows flexible storage for additional user preferences.  

- #### Transactional Integrity and ACID Compliance  

  PostgreSQL ensures reliable data consistency by:  
  - Safely handling email subscriptions without errors.  
  - Recording delivery status of sent emails.  
  - Accurately updating user preferences without corruption.  

So these are all the reasons that makes postgreSQL a strong  choice for our Email Newsletter .
