# What's a newsletter for a blog 

A newsletter for a blog is a regular communication sent to subscribers, typically via email, that provides updates, highlights, and new content from the blog. The purpose of a blog newsletter is to keep readers engaged, informed, and connected to the blog's content and community.

## purpose of newsletter

- Engagement: Keep readers engaged with your blog by regularly providing them with new and interesting content.
- Retention: Encourage readers to return to your blog by reminding them of new posts and updates.
- Community Building: Foster a sense of community by featuring reader contributions, comments, and interactions.
- Promotion: Promote new blog posts, upcoming events, and other relevant information.

## How to Implement a newsletter for a blog in Rust

1. Rust and Cargo

- Rust: The programming language you will use to write your application.
- Installation: Use rustup to install Rust.
- Command: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
- Cargo: The Rust package manager and build system. It is used to manage dependencies and build your project.

2. Web Framework

We are going to use the axum framework.
Axum is a modern, asynchronous web framework for Rust, built on top of Tokio and Tower. It is designed to be modular, flexible, and easy to use.

Purposes of Axum

- Building Web Applications and APIs: Quickly build web apps and APIs.
- Asynchronous Programming: Handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
- Modularity and Flexibility: Use a variety of middleware and components.
- Ergonomic API: Simple and intuitive API for common tasks.

Usage: Set up routes, handle forms, and serve static files.

3. Serialization/Deserialization

- serde: A powerful and flexible serialization and deserialization library for Rust.
- serde_json: A JSON serialization and deserialization library that works with serde.
Purpose: To handle JSON data for API interactions and form submissions.

4. Database Interaction

- sqlx: An async SQL library for Rust that works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- Purpose: To interact with the database for storing and retrieving subscriber information.
- Features: Supports async operations, migrations, and query building.

5. Email Sending

- lettre: A powerful and flexible email sending library for Rust.
- Purpose: To send emails to subscribers.
- Features: Supports SMTP, email templating, and attachments.

6. Environment Variables Management

- dotenv: A library to load environment variables from a .env file.
- Purpose: To manage sensitive information like database credentials and SMTP settings.
- Usage: Load environment variables at runtime to keep sensitive data out of your codebase.
7. Database

- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- Purpose: To store subscriber information.
Table Structure:

```sh
CREATE DATABASE newsletter;
\c newsletter;
CREATE TABLE subscribers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    subscribed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

8. Email Service Provider (ESP)

- SMTP Configuration: Configure the SMTP server settings and credentials.
- Purpose: To set up the email server for sending newsletters.
- ESP Integration: Use an Email Service Provider (ESP) like Mailchimp, Sendinblue, or ConvertKit for additional features and management.
- Purpose: To leverage additional features and management tools provided by ESPs.

9. Cron Jobs

- Cron Jobs: To automate the process of sending out the newsletter at regular intervals.
- Purpose: To ensure the newsletter is sent at a specific time. It is to set up cron jobs to run scripts that generate and send the newsletter.

10. Testing and Validation

- Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure individual components of your application work as expected.
- Purpose: To verify the correctness of individual components.
- Integration Tests: Write integration tests to ensure different components work together as expected.
- Purpose: To verify the interaction between components.
- End-to-End Tests: Test the entire subscription and newsletter sending process from the user interface to the email delivery.
- Purpose: To ensure the entire process works as expected.
- Debugging Tools: Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix issues during development.
- Purpose: To identify and resolve issues during development.

11. Error Handling and Logging

- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage and log errors that may occur during the process.
- Purpose: To handle and log errors for better debugging and user experience.
- Logging: Use a logging library to log important events and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- Purpose: To keep a record of important events and errors for analysis.

12. Security

- Secure Connections: Use HTTPS to secure the communication between the client and the server.
- Purpose: To ensure secure communication.
- Usage: Obtain and configure SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS.
- Input Validation: Validate input data to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Purpose: To ensure data integrity and security.
- Usage: Use validation libraries or custom validation logic to ensure input data meets the required format and constraints.
- Data Protection: Protect sensitive data, such as email addresses and personal information, by using secure storage and transmission methods.
- Purpose: To ensure the privacy and security of user data.
- Usage: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit, and follow best practices for data protection.

13. Deployment

- Web Hosting: Host your web server on a reliable platform.
- Purpose: To make your application accessible to the public. It is used to choose a hosting provider that supports Rust and async web frameworks.
- Cloud Services: Use cloud services like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean to host your application.
- Purpose: To leverage scalable and reliable infrastructure. It is used to deploy your application to a cloud platform for easy scaling and management.
- Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your application for easier deployment and management.
- Purpose: To ensure consistent and reproducible environments. It is used to create a Dockerfile to build and run your application in a container.
- Database Hosting: Host your database on a reliable platform.
- Purpose: To ensure the database is scalable and secure, It uses cloud database services like AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres, or DigitalOcean Managed Databases.
- Database Scaling: Ensure your database can scale to handle a growing number of subscribers.
- Purpose: To maintain performance as your user base grows. It is used to implement auto-scaling, read replicas, or other scaling strategies as needed.
