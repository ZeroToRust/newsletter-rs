## How to Implement a newsletter for a blog

To implement a database you need to take into consideration the following key components:

1. **Database Management**

    Manage and store subscriber information efficiently.
- Database Connection: Use a database connection library like diesel to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database.
- Subscription Table: Define a schema for the subscribers table to store email, name, and subscription status.
- CRUD Operations: Implement functions to add, delete, read, and update subscriber information using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities provided by diesel.
2. **Email Sending**

    Configure and send the newsletter to subscribers.
- SMTP Client: Use the lettre library to configure and use an SMTP client for sending emails.
- Email Template: Use a template engine like tera to create and manage HTML and plain text templates for the newsletter.
- Email Sending Function: Implement a function to send the newsletter to all subscribers using the SMTP client and templates.
3. **Content Generation**

    Gather and prepare the content for the newsletter.
- Blog Post Retrieval: Use an HTTP client like reqwest to fetch recent blog posts from your blog's API or scrape the blog if necessary.
- Content Curation: Select and summarize the most relevant and engaging blog posts, and include images and other media.
- HTML Template: Use a template engine like tera to design and generate HTML content for the newsletter, ensuring it is visually appealing and easy to read.
4. **Scheduling and Automation**

    Automate the process of sending the newsletter at specific times.
- Task Scheduling: Use a task scheduling library like cron to schedule the sending of emails at specific times or intervals.
- Background Jobs: Use an asynchronous runtime like tokio to handle the sending of emails asynchronously, ensuring the main application remains responsive and can manage failures and retries.
5. **Analytics and Feedback**

    Track the performance of the newsletter and gather feedback to improve future issues.
- Open Rates: Use an email tracking service or implement tracking pixels to track how many recipients open the newsletter.
- Click Rates: Use URL shorteners or tracking services with unique parameters to track how many recipients click on links in the newsletter.
- Feedback: Provide a way for recipients to give feedback or suggest improvements, such as including a feedback form or a direct email address in the newsletter.
- Unsubscribe Rates: Monitor the number of unsubscribes to understand reader engagement and identify potential issues, and use unsubscribe pages to gather reasons for unsubscribing.
