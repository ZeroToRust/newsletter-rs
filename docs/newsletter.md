## How to Implement a newsletter for a blog
## 1. Prepare the newsletter strategy

**Define your newsletter objectives**

Before setting out to create a newsletter, you should define your objectives. Successful newsletters are goal-oriented, audience-specific, and support a larger marketing strategy.

**Decide how your newsletter will add new values**

One of your top priorities in creating a newsletter should be providing real value to your subscribers. If your campaigns offer nothing but promotional content, your open rates and click-through rates will suffer.

## 2. Choose a newsletter software

Creating a newsletter is definitely simple, but making sure it gets delivered is another story. If you tried sending a campaign to even just a few hundred contacts in Gmail or Outlook, it’s unlikely to ever reach your subscribers’ inboxes. For this reason, having a dedicated email marketing platform is essential.
